To know of the design patterns can make you a better programmer by being aware of different ones. From my perspective if you would have initialized a class that handles data differently you can go a lot of ways about it and achieve the saem result. But some are better than others on a long-term and bigger scale project. And you would have reached a point where you would implement a different design pattern to achieve a certain goal.
